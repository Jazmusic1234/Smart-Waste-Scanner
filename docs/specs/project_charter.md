# Project Charter (4-5 pages)

### High Level Description

*****************
### Project Overview (1/2 page)
###### *Summarize the project in layperson’s terms (e.g., one that a non-engineer could understand). This should not be more than one paragraph.*


*****************
### Project Approach (1-2 pages)
###### *Provide more details about what you will accomplish and how you plan to accomplish it.*

*****************
###### *List your objectives,  milestones, and deliverables. What are the specific deliverables of the project for this quarter? What are potential longer term goals? Deliverables should include a description, a date, and the responsible persons. Describe a minimum viable product and how you can iterate upon that over the quarter. (1-2 pages)*

*****************
### Constraints, Risk, and Feasibility (1/2-1 page)
###### *What are the potential stumbling blocks? What is realistically feasible here? The quarter goes by very quickly. The better approach is to over-deliver on what you promise, rather than under deliver on a set of unrealistic goals. Be sure to include risks – a list of things that could go wrong and how to avoid them.*
