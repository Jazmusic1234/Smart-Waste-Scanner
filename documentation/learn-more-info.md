Glass is a better alternative than plastic when it comes to recycling, but glass is one of the least properly recycled materials out there!  Though some glass can be recycled over and over again, making it a good choice, other types of glass (such as ceramics, lightbulbs, and mirrors) contain other materials in addition to the regular glass, so they cannot be recycled.  A good way to make sure your glass is recyclable is to look out for any indications on the packaging.  Another great way is to ask yourself: is it a bottle, jar, or container?
