  * N/A
* How will you do testing?
  * Each team will test their own portion
  * Machine learning/Computer Vision team
    * Test data sets and make sure that program outputs the correct type of classification for each object
    * Test using real life objects that not in data set
  * UI/UX team 
    * Test that buttons and pop ups work properly

    * Use Cypress unit tests

* How will you do documentation?
  * All code and documentation will be done on Github and there will be a specific style guideline to follow
  * Must have comments and headers for code
  * Check in 4 times a week M/W/F/Sun which will be logged on Github (what you accomplished, what you got stuck on, what you are working on moving forward)
